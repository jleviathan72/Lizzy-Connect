## 📝 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Version 1.3.0 as Current
**Decision:** Use `Lizzy_Agentic_Commerce_CRM_Requirements_v1.3.0.md` as the current version.

**Rationale:**
- 73 KB vs 53 KB (20 KB larger)
- 2,867 lines vs 2,125 lines (742 more lines)
- More comprehensive content
- Likely the finalized version

**Action:** Shorter v1.3 file moved to `archive/` as earlier draft.

### 2. Directory Structure
**Decision:** Follow your README's proposed structure exactly.

**Benefits:**
- Matches your existing documentation
- All README links will work
- Logical organization
- Professional presentation

### 3. License
**Decision:** Created proprietary license under Leviathan Consulting Group LLC.

**Includes:**
- Your company name
- Copyright notice
- Usage restrictions
- Contact info (jonathan@leviathangroup.com)

### 4. Archive Folder
**Decision:** Keep earlier v1.3 draft in archive, not delete.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves work history
- May have useful content
- Easy to compare versions
- Can delete later if not needed
